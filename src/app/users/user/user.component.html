<!-- 
  <a href="/tasks">
  on every click entire page is loaded again. We are in a single page application so only the required component must be updated.
  So this is not a preffered way to load our routes.
  use routerLink directive instead.

  Angular intercepts the browser's default behavior, preventing the refetching of the HTML document. 
  It then examines the path, consults the route configuration, and loads the appropriate component without leaving the single page application context. 
  This is the purpose of RouterLink.
  <a routerLink="/tasks">
  But like this it won't work, since routerLink is a directive from angular and without importing it in component, it wont be detected.
