    /*
      Here we are storing a value in localStorage on every key stroke, this is not ideal for perforance, 
      so adding debounceTime in pipe.
      debounceTime => takes a time value as parameter and if a value is emitted in that period it will discard that value.
      This will makes sure we don't write if user is still typing, only if user stops typing for 500 ms, emitted value will make it to next function.
    1. Start Timer:
    When the source observable emits a value, debouncetime starts a timer for the specified duration. 
    2. Reset Timer on New Emissions:
    If another value is emitted from the source observable before the timer runs out, the previous timer is discarded, and a new timer starts. 
    3. Emit Last Value:
    Only when the timer successfully completes without any new emissions will the last emitted value be passed through.

       then it run only once since we add it in a constructor which is executed only once,
       but when it runs we add a listener to the observabe returned by form.valueChanges, to do something after value is changed.

/*
afterNextRender() is used to run code after Angular has completed the current render cycle, meaning:

The DOM has been updated.

Any UI changes from reactive updates (like signals or inputs) have been flushed.

This is useful when you want to:

Measure layout (e.g., element dimensions).

Trigger animations after the DOM is fully updated.

Run logic that depends on the final rendered state.

afterNextRender() does not only run the first time a component is initialized ‚Äî it runs every time you call it, and it waits until the next render cycle completes.

üîÅ Reusability

You can call afterNextRender():

Inside ngAfterViewInit (on init).

Inside any lifecycle hook.

Inside an event handler (e.g., after a button click).

Inside a signal or effect.

Each time you call it, Angular will schedule your callback to run after the next DOM update, even if the component has already been initialized long ago.

@Component({
  selector: 'example',
  template: `
    <button (click)="update()">Update</button>
    <div #box>{{ count() }}</div>
  `,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  count = signal(0);
  @ViewChild('box') box!: ElementRef;

  update() {
    this.count.update(v => v + 1);

    afterNextRender().then(() => {
      console.log('DOM updated. New height:', this.box.nativeElement.offsetHeight);
    });
  }
}

Each time you click the button:

The signal (count) updates.

Angular re-renders the DOM.

afterNextRender() fires after the DOM is stable.
